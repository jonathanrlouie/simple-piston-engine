# simple-piston-engine
A simple game engine built with Piston and inspired by Amethyst.

## About

This is a simple game engine built using `piston_window`. It is inspired by the Amethyst game engine
and uses a similar pushdown automata for game state management, as well as an entity-component-system model. This ECS is not nearly
as efficient as Amethyst's, but I only intended for this game engine to be used in my own personal projects anyway. Still, I decided 
to make this project open-source, in case it helps any other new Rust game developers trying to figure out how to get started with a 
project.

Example game coming soon!
